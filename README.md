# Aha! Deadlines Reminders

Python (Python 3) script for checking upcoming deadlines and posting them on the #schedule channel on Slack.

### Usage

Run the script with either zero or one arguments. The argument should be an integer that signifies seeing dealines that are less than or equal to that number of days away. If no integer value is given, it defaults to 7.

Example: `./reminders 5`

I can't guarantee compatability with Python 2.
